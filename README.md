**Game description**: 2D puzzle game like a Rubik’s Cube

**Description**: The first finished project, made independently in Unity engine. The creation process took about 3 months, then about another 3 months for testing and finalization. All assets were created by me.

At the start of the game, the cubes are always shuffled. The player moves the cubes on a touchscreen device. The goal is to return the cubes to their original positions. The player can only move an entire row or column at a time. The time taken to complete the task is recorded in the statistics. This time is also shown to the player at the end of the level. After completing a level, the player will also see an ad.

The most challenging part was finding the right algorithm to move an entire row or column. I had to ensure that the movements were smooth and intuitive, while also considering performance optimization. Another difficulty was creating an algorithm to check the current position of the cells and verify if the task had been completed. This required careful handling of state changes and efficient comparison of the puzzle’s progress.
